# Appendix A. Integrating with Pygame

This appendix shows how to set up the Pygame library and how to use Pygame for window management in an OpenCV application. Also, the appendix gives an overview of Pygame's other functionality and some resources for learning Pygame.

# Installing Pygame

Let's assume that we already have Python set up according to one of the approaches described in [Chapter 1](1.html#filepos39383 "Chapter 1. Setting up OpenCV"), *Setting up OpenCV*. Depending on our existing setup, we can install Pygame in one of the following ways:

*   Windows with 32-bit Python: Download and install Pygame 1.9.1 from [http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi](http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi).
*   Windows with 64-bit Python: Download and install Pygame 1.9.2 preview from [http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/2k2kdosm/pygame-1.9.2pre.win-amd64-py2.7.exe](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/2k2kdosm/pygame-1.9.2pre.win-amd64-py2.7.exe).
*   Mac with Macports: Open **Terminal** and run the following command:

    ```py

    $ sudo port install py27-game

    ```

*   Mac with Homebrew: Open **Terminal** and run the following commands to install Pygame's dependencies and, then, Pygame itself:

    ```py

    $ brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf smpeg portmidi
    $ /usr/local/share/python/pip install \
    > hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

    ```

*   Ubuntu and its derivatives: Open **Terminal** and run the following command:

    ```py

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pygame

    ```

*   Other Unix-like systems: Pygame is available in the standard repositories of many systems. Typical package names include `pygame`, `pygame27`, `py-game`, `py27-game`, `python-pygame,` and `python27-pygame`.

Now, Pygame should be ready for use.

# Documentation and tutorials

Pygame's API documentation and some tutorials can be found online at [http://www.pygame.org/docs/](http://www.pygame.org/docs/).

Al Sweigart's *Making Games With Python and Pygame* is a cookbook for recreating several classic games in Pygame 1.9.1\. The free electronic version is available online at [http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/) or as a downloadable PDF file at [http://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf](http://inventwithpython.com/makinggames.pdf).

# Subclassing managers.WindowManager

As discussed in [Chapter 2](2.html#filepos93177 "Chapter 2. Handling Files, Cameras, and GUIs"), *Handling Cameras, Files and GUIs*, our object-oriented design allows us to easily swap OpenCV's HighGUI window manager for another window manager, such as Pygame. To do so, we just need to subclass our `managers.WindowManager` class and override four methods: `createWindow()`, `show()`, `destroyWindow()`, and `processEvents()`. Also, we need to import some new dependencies.

To proceed, we need the `managers.py` file from [Chapter 2](2.html#filepos93177 "Chapter 2. Handling Files, Cameras, and GUIs"), *Handling Cameras, Files, and GUIs* and the `utils.py` file from [Chapter 4](4.html#filepos199799 "Chapter 4. Tracking Faces with Haar Cascades"), *Tracking Faces with Haar Cascades*. From `utils.py`, we only need one function, `isGray()`, which we implemented in [Chapter 4](4.html#filepos199799 "Chapter 4. Tracking Faces with Haar Cascades"), *Tracking Faces with Haar Cascades*. Let's edit `managers.py` to add the following imports:

```py
import pygame
import utils
```

Also in `managers.py`, somewhere after our `WindowManager` implementation, we want to add our new subclass called `PygameWindowManager`:

```py
class PygameWindowManager(WindowManager):
    def createWindow(self):
        pygame.display.init()
        pygame.display.set_caption(self._windowName)
        self._isWindowCreated = True
    def show(self, frame):
        # Find the frame's dimensions in (w, h) format.
        frameSize = frame.shape[1::-1]
        # Convert the frame to RGB, which Pygame requires.
        if utils.isGray(frame):
            conversionType = cv2.COLOR_GRAY2RGB
        else:
            conversionType = cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB
        rgbFrame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, conversionType)
        # Convert the frame to Pygame's Surface type.
        pygameFrame = pygame.image.frombuffer(
            rgbFrame.tostring(), frameSize, 'RGB')
        # Resize the window to match the frame.
        displaySurface = pygame.display.set_mode(frameSize)
        # Blit and display the frame.
        displaySurface.blit(pygameFrame, (0, 0))
        pygame.display.flip()
    def destroyWindow(self):
        pygame.display.quit()
        self._isWindowCreated = False
    def processEvents(self):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and \
                    self.keypressCallback is not None:
                self.keypressCallback(event.key)
            elif event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                self.destroyWindow()
                return
```

Note that we are using two Pygame modules: `pygame.display` and `pygame.event`.

A window is created by calling `pygame.display.init()` and destroyed by calling `pygame.display.quit()`. Repeated calls to `display.init()` have no effect, as Pygame is intended for single-window applications only. The Pygame window has a drawing surface of type `pygame.Surface`. To get a reference to this `Surface`, we can call `pygame.display.get_surface()` or `pygame.display.set_mode()`. The latter function modifies the `Surface` entity's properties before returning it. A `Surface` entity has a `blit()` method, which takes, as arguments, another `Surface` and a coordinate pair where the latter `Surface` should be "blitted" (drawn) onto the first. When we are done updating the window's `Surface` for the current frame, we should display it by calling `pygame.display.flip()`.

Events, such as `keypresses`, are polled by calling `pygame.event.get()`, which returns the list of all events that have occurred since the last call. Each event is of type `pygame.event.Event` and has the property `type`, which indicates the category of an event such as `pygame.KEYDOWN` for keypresses and `pygame.QUIT` for the window's **Close** button being clicked. Depending on the value of `type`, an `Event` entity may have other properties, such as `key` (an ASCII key code) for the `KEYDOWN` events.

Relative to the base `WindowManager` that uses HighGUI, `PygameWindowManager` incurs some overhead cost by converting between OpenCV's image format and Pygame's `Surface` format of each frame. However, `PygameWindowManager` offers normal window closing behavior, whereas the base `WindowManager` does not.

# Modifying the application

Let's modify the `cameo.py` file to use `PygameWindowManager` instead of `WindowManager`. Find the following line in `cameo.py`:

```py
from managers import WindowManager, CaptureManager
```

Replace it with:

```py
from managers import PygameWindowManager as WindowManager, \
                     CaptureManager
```

That's all! Now `cameo.py` uses a Pygame window that should close when the standard **Close** button is clicked.

# Further uses of Pygame

We have used only some basic functions of the `pygame.display` and `pygame.event` modules. Pygame provides much more functionality, including:

*   Drawing 2D geometry
*   Drawing text
*   Managing groups of drawable AI entities (sprites)
*   Capturing various input events relating to the window, keyboard, mouse, and joysticks/gamepads
*   Creating custom events
*   Playback and synthesis of sounds and music

For example, Pygame might be a suitable backend for a game that uses computer vision, whereas HighGUI would not be.

# Summary

By now, we should have an application that uses OpenCV for capturing (and possibly manipulating) images, while using Pygame for displaying the images and catching events. Starting from this basic integration example, you might want to expand `PygameWindowManager` to wrap additional Pygame functionality or you might want to create another `WindowManager` subclass to wrap another library.
